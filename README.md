# penndot-ID-front-facing-scan-QR (previously)
current front facing barcode

realizing from a test at a local store on an older infrared scanner nor does testing on a newer infrared scanner which also doesn't input newer QR code square serialized data compared to barcode serialized data

better to just use back bar code insteae or a square QR code since physical infrared scanner devices would have to add a ccd camera per scanner in order to input QR codes or software patching per physical infrared scanner

*EASE*of use to display instead of removing from a wallet or holder
